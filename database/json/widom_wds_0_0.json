    "decription": " Universal Double Switch",
    "overview": "<p>Universal Double Switch is an ON\/OFF control device designed to independently control two separate loads, suited for use as both a local and remote switch. Similarly to the other WiDom \u201cin wall\u201d devices, it can be fully integrated into pre-existing systems and configured to associate configurable behaviours to a specific number of clicks, in full integration with the Z-Wave home automation ecosystem.<\/p> <p>Each of its two channels features an integrated consumption measurement device. The Universal Double Switch also boasts the lowest energy consumption on the market.<\/p> <p>At the same time, it is completely configurable so that it can adapt to the most varied needs while also being ready to be used without needing additional configurations in order to operate.<\/p> <p>Thanks to the framework developed by WiDom, the various types of \u201cevents\u201d on the \u201cExternal Switch\u201d can be recognised and associated to actions to be performed on the device, on any associated devices, on all devices on the network. The events that the system recognises are the number of \u201cclicks\u201d or hold on the External Switch.<\/p> <p><br \/>External switch: External button or switch connected to the input I1 or I2<\/p> <p>Events: The actions performed on the external Switch: Clicks or Hold.<\/p> <p>Click: If the external switch is a button (when pressed it autonomously returns to the initial position), a click means pressing and then releasing it. If the external switch is bistable (when pressed it does not return to the initial position), a single click means one single flip of the switch.<\/p> <p>Technical Specifications<\/p> <p>Power Supply: 230 VAC\u00b110% 50\/60 Hz<br \/>Maximum Load on Relay Resistive Loads: 8 A for each channel; 10A for both channels<br \/>Limit Temperature: 105 \u00b0C<br \/>Work Temperature: -10 \u2013 40 \u00b0C<br \/>Radio Protocol Z-Wave: 868,4 MHz<br \/>Radio Range: Up to 100 m outdoor, Up to 40 m indoor<br \/>Dimensions (WxDxH): 37x37x17 mm<br \/>Consumption: &lt; 260 mW in standby; &lt; 480 mW with one working load; &lt; 700 mW with both working loads<br \/>Electrical IP Rating: IP 20<br \/>Actuator element: Relay<br \/>Conformity: CE, RoHS<\/p>",
    "inclusion": "<p>The device supports both the Network Wide Inclusion (which offers the opportunity of inclusion into a network even if the device is not directly connected to the controller) and the Normal Inclusion mechanisms.<\/p> <p>If the device is not included into a Z-Wave network, a single click on the (B) button or on one of the external switches will launch the process of traditional inclusion. If the device inclusion procedure does not start within 2 seconds, the Network Wide Inclusion network will be launched lasting a variable amount of time between 15-30 seconds.<\/p> <p>INFO: Through the inclusion procedure, activated with a single click on one of the external switches, the system determines the type of external switch (see parameter No. 62).<\/p>",
    "exclusion": "<p>Only a controller can remove a device from the network. WiDom Universal Double Switch is compatible with all Z-Wave certified controllers. After the exclusion procedure has been activated by the controller, the device can be removed, putting it in Exclusion Mode by three consecutive clicks on the (B) button or on the external switch, when available.<\/p>",

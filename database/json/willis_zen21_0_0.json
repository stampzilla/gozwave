    "overview": "<p>PRODUCT FEATURES:\u00a0<br \/>- Manual or remote on\/off control from your mobile device or computer (when included to a Z-Wave gateway controller)\u00a0<br \/>- Z-Wave Plus with improved 500 chip for faster and safer wireless communication\u00a0<br \/>- Works with LED, CFL, and incandescent bulbs\u00a0<br \/>- Based on universal binary switch command class - supported by most Z-Wave controllers\u00a0<br \/>- May be associated and grouped with other Z-Wave devices for advanced home automation\u00a0<br \/>- Simple elegant design with screwless snap-on wall plate included\u00a0<br \/>- Built-in Z-Wave signal repeater for a stronger and more reliable network\u00a0<br \/>- Single pole installation only, neutral wire required\u00a0<br \/><br \/>SPECIFICATIONS:\u00a0<br \/>Model Number: ZEN21\u00a0<br \/>Z-Wave Signal Frequency: 908.42 MHz\u00a0<br \/>Power: 120 VAC, 60 Hz\u00a0<br \/>Maximum Loads: 960W Incandescent, 1800W (15A) Resistive, \u00bd HP Motor\u00a0<br \/>Range: Up to 100 feet line of sight between the Wireless Controller and the closest Z-Wave receiver module\u00a0<br \/>Operating Temperature: 32-104\u00b0 F (0-40\u00b0 C)\u00a0<br \/>Installation and Use: Indoor only<\/p>",
    "inclusion": "<p>1. Bring your Z-Wave gateway hub or controller as close to the switch as possible<\/p> <p>2. Put your Z-Wave controller in inclusion mode<\/p> <p>3. Tap the switch on and off quickly 3 times to finalize the inclusion process<\/p> <p>4. A new on\/off device should appear on your controller's device list<\/p> <p>Troubleshooting Tips:<\/p> <p>If you are unable to include the Z-Wave switch to your controller, please try one of the following:<\/p> <p>- Bring the controller closer to your Z-Wave switch or use a hand-held secondary controller for inclusion<\/p> <p>- Tap your Z-Wave switch quicker 4 or 5 times once you put the controller in the inclusion mode to ensure the command has gone through<\/p> <p>- Put your controller in the EXCLUSION mode and tap the switch quickly 3 times, then try adding it to your network again\u00a0<\/p>",
    "exclusion": "<p>1. Bring your Z-Wave gateway hub or controller as close to the switch as possible<\/p> <p>2. Put your Z-Wave controller in exclusion mode<\/p> <p>3. Tap the switch on and off quickly 3 times to complete the exclusion process<\/p> <p>4. The device should disappear from your controller's device list<\/p> <p>Please repeat the process following all steps carefully if the first attempt is unsuccessful\u00a0<\/p>",
    "wakeup": "<p>The switch will be reset to factory defaults only by exclusion using a Z-Wave controller. You may use any certified Z-Wave controller to exclude and reset the switch. This device may not be reset manually when the network\u2019s primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable. NOTE: All previously recorded activity and custom settings will be erased from the device\u2019s memory.\u00a0<\/p>",

Z-Wave nodes of other types can\u00a0be added to the system and will also act as repeaters if they support this function of repeating the signal received to\u00a0other modules in the system.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As part of a Z-Wave network, the ZRW230 will also act as a wireless repeater to insure that commands intended for\u00a0another device in the network are received. This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range\u00a0of the wireless controller.<\/p> <p>There are no field repairable assemblies on this unit.. If service is needed, the unit must be returned where purchased.<\/p>",

    "inclusion": "<p>DEVICE INCLUSION\/ EXCLUSION<\/p> <p>The process of \"Inclusion\/ Exclusion\" is to Add or Remove the device from the Hub. All Z-Wave devices must be \"Included\" on the Controller (Hub) before it can be controlled from a smart device. The Hub should be brought physically closer to the device just for the \"Inclusion\" process (recommended within 10ft). When finished, the Hub and device can be moved back to final installation location. Download the App or log onto the website associated with the Hub you are using and follow their Inclusion\/ Exclusion instructions as each Hub's programming and features are different.<\/p> <p>\u2022 During the Inclusion\/ Exclusion process, the Program Button on the relay or the ON\/OFF toggle on the switch can be used for including\/ excluding the device.<\/p> <p>o When using the ON\/OFF toggle, the toggle must be toggled ON and OFF 3 times.<\/p> <p>\u2022 It is best to perform an Exclusion of the device prior to performing an Inclusion.<\/p> <p>Step 1. From the Control Panel, go the the device Exclusion page.<\/p> <p>o Select \"Exclude Device\".<\/p> <p>o When prompted, press the Program Button on the Relay once or the ON\/OFF toggle on the switch 3 times.<\/p> <p>Step 2. Go to the \"Add Device\" page.<\/p> <p>o Select \"Include Device\".<\/p> <p>o When prompted, press the Program Button on the Relay once or the ON\/OFF toggle on the switch 3 times.<\/p> <p>The primary controller should indicate that the action was successful. If the controller indicates the action was unsuccessful, please repeat from Step 1. Once the relay is part of the network, the same basic procedure is used to add<\/p> <p>the relay to groups &amp; scenes or change advanced functions. Refer to the Hub\u2019s instructions for details. Step 3. Follow the On-Screen instructions in the Control Panel on adding or removing rooms, scenes, other devices, and other functions and features.<\/p>",

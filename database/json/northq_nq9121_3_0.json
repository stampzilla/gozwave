    "overview": "<p>The Power Reader is a metering device capable of counting pulses from any electricity or gas meters. The device stores timestamped consumption in its internal memory every 15 minutes. Note: The Power Reader for electricity metering has different firmware than the Power Reader for gas metering. Please make sure you have the appropriate firmware on your device before you start integrating \/ installing it. The proper way of distinguishing between the two firmware versions is by using the MANUFACTURER SPECIFIC command class.<\/p> <p>http:\/\/northq.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Technical-Integration.pdf<\/p>",
    "inclusion": "<p>In order to include the Power\/Gas Reader in a Z-Wave network, the device must first have its network settings cleared. New devices fulfill this requirement be default. Power Readers with firmware version up to 3.24 and Gas Readers with firmware version up to 3.30 can have their network settings cleared by pressing 7 times on the button, however it is not recommended to do so because the Z-Wave controller will not be informed that the device has been reset. Power Readers with firmware version equal or larger than 3.29 and Gas Readers with firmware version equal or larger than 3.34 do not reset their network settings if the button has been pressed 7 times. To clear them, any Z-Wave controller must be placed in Exclusion mode first and the button on the device must be pressed 3 times.<\/p>",
    "exclusion": "<p>In order to exclude the Power\/Gas Reader from a Z-Wave network, place the controller in remove mode first and then press the button on the device 3 times.<\/p>",
    "wakeup": "<p>The Power Reader has two functioning modes:<\/p> <p>- Real-time mode: the device will be awake and keep the antenna on. It will stay in real-time a predefined number of seconds (900).<\/p> <p>- Normal mode: the device will be in sleep and only wake up according to the interval defined by the WAKE UP SET command.<\/p>",
